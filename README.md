- ### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Henry Wrightson.

#### ðŸŒŸ About Me:
- **Profession:** Senior Data Scientist at the UK Government Digital Service.
- **Expertise:** Specialising in Data Science, including Data Analysis, Visualization, Privacy, Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and more. Beyond technical skills, I'm passionate about People Management, Coaching, Mentoring, and Project Management.
  
#### ðŸ’¼ Professional Snapshot:
As a Senior Data Scientist, my career is rooted in statistics, programming, and ML. I'm currently engrossed in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and NLP to tackle business challenges, always aiming to bridge the gap between complex data insights and stakeholder needs. My toolbox is filled with skills in stakeholder engagement, AI/ML development, and deploying solutions from conception to production. I'm deeply committed to promoting growth, both in technology and within teams.

#### ðŸ”§ Current Projects:
- **Custom RAG Applications:** Innovating with [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/), [Huggingface](https://hf.co), and [OpenAI](https://openai.com).
- **LLM Infrastructure Exploration:** Experimenting with AWS and GCP (Gemini, BQ ML, AWS Bedrock) to enhance our project capabilities.
- **In-House NLP Pipeline Development and Maintenance:** 
  - Created using [SF Hamilton](https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/hamilton), our pipeline features an SK Learn-powered Random Forest spam classifier developed using PyCaret, a sentiment analysis ensemble using Huggingface models, and a within-topic topic modeling process using BERTopic and GSDMM. 
  - Deployed on GCP, our pipeline's resilience is ensured through Docker Containers, managed via Terraform for seamless integration and scalability.

#### ðŸš€ Recent Hackathon Participation:
- Practical application of Microsoft Azure services at the [PwC/CDDO Generative Artificial Intelligence Government Hackathon](https://cddo.blog.gov.uk/2024/01/22/inside-the-largest-global-ai-hack/), demonstrating the potential of AI in governmental applications.
- Explored innovative AI solutions at the [Anthropic London Hackathon](https://aifringe.org/events/anthropic-hackathon-london), toying with the context window of Claude 2 in an attempt to revolutionise NHS practices.
